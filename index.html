                <br><br><br>
                <ul>    
                    <li>In The Breakfast Club (1985), the scene in which all the characters sit in a circle on the floor in the library and tell stories about how they ended up in detention was not scripted. Hughes encouraged them to ad-lib.</li> <br>
                    <li>In an interview at Comic-Con, Kelly LeBrock said when she did the kissing scene with 14-year-old Ilan Mitchell Smith in Weird Science (1985), he got carried away and stuck his tongue down her throat. Afterward, she told him, "If you ever do that again, I'm going to kick your ass!"</li> <br>
                    <li>In Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986), to produce the desired drugged-out effect for his role as the drug addict in the police station, Charlie Sheen stayed awake for more than 48 hours before the scene was shot.</li> <br>
                    <li>In National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989), when Clark (Chevy Chase) failed to get the Christmas lights to work one last time, he takes his frustration out on the plastic decorations in the front yard. Chase ended up breaking his pinky finger while punching Santa Claus. He then resorts to kicking and clubbing the decorations after that.</li> <br>
                    <li>Macaulay Culkin was paid $4.5 million to star in Home Alone 2: Lost in New York; it was the biggest salary ever for a 12-year-old child actor.</li>
