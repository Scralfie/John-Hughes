                    was an American

                    went on
                    to Hollywood to write, produce and sometimes direct some of the most successful live-action comedy
                    films
                    of the 1980s such as National Lampoon's Vacation, Mr. Mom, Sixteen Candles, Weird Science, The
                    Breakfast
                    Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Pretty in Pink, Some Kind of Wonderful, Planes, Trains and
                    Automobiles, She's Having a Baby, Uncle Buck, Home Alone, Dutch, Beethoven (co-written under the
                    pseudonym Edmond Dantès), Dennis the Menace, and Baby's Day Out.

                <br><br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>In The Breakfast Club (1985), the scene in which all the characters sit in a circle on the floor
                        in the library and tell stories about how they ended up in detention was not scripted. Hughes
                        encouraged them to ad-lib.</li> <br>
                    <li>In an interview at Comic-Con, Kelly LeBrock said when she did the kissing scene with 14-year-old
                        Ilan Mitchell Smith in Weird Science (1985), he got carried away and stuck his tongue down her
                        throat. Afterward, she told him, "If you ever do that again, I'm going to kick your ass!"</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>In Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986), to produce the desired drugged-out effect for his role as
                        the drug addict in the police station, Charlie Sheen stayed awake for more than 48 hours before
                        the scene was shot.</li> <br>
                    <li>In National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989), when Clark (Chevy Chase) failed to get the
                        Christmas lights to work one last time, he takes his frustration out on the plastic decorations
                        in the front yard. Chase ended up breaking his pinky finger while punching Santa Claus. He then
                        resorts to kicking and clubbing the decorations after that.</li> <br>
                    <li>Macaulay Culkin was paid $4.5 million to star in Home Alone 2: Lost in New York; it was the
                        biggest salary ever for a 12-year-old child actor.</li>
